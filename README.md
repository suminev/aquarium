### A simple Aquarium project in your browser

The project implements an imitation of the aquarium and its inhabitants. There are 8 different types of fish in total. Their movement speed is randomly generated. When the fish reaches the left and right ends of the screen, it changes its direction to the opposite and continues moving further.

In the source code, you can adjust the number of fish output. To do this, change the COUNT_FISH value to the desired one. As a result, an array of allFish objects will be filled, with all the fish.

In the loop loop, rendering and moving will be started for each object in the allFish loop.
